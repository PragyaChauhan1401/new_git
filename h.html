        <li><b>Mission Status:</b> In Development</li>
        <li><b>Objective:</b>To further explore the Moon's surface.</li>
        
        <h2><u>Mission Details</u></h2>
        <li>Chandrayaan-3 is the third lunar exploration mission by ISRO, 
        building upon the successes of Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2.           </li>
        <li>The mission aims to send a lander and rover to the Moon's 
        surface to conduct scientific experiments, gather data, and 
        capture images. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover
        named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The 
        propulsion module carried the lander and rover configuration to 
        lunar orbit in preparation for a powered descent by the lander.           </li>
        
        <h2><u>Current Status</u></h2>
        <li>The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander 
        touched down in the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023 at 
        12:32 UTC, making India the fourth country to successfully land on 
        the Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar south                     pole.Chandrayaan-3:Pragyan Rover has confirmed sulphur presence on
